## ⚡ Lightning Start

Get three AI agents working in parallel in under 2 minutes:

```bash
# 1. Clone your new repo (after creating it from the template on GitHub)
# 2. Open terminal in the repo folder, then run:
./init-agents.sh
```

**That's it!** Three VS Code windows will open automatically—one for each agent (Claude, Codex, Gemini). In each window, open the terminal and run the corresponding CLI:

| Window | Run this |
|--------|----------|
| Claude | `claude` |
| Codex | `codex` |
| Gemini | `gemini` |

Give each agent their task, and you're off to the races. 🏎️

> **📖 Need more control?** The rest of this README walks through the manual setup process step-by-step. Use it if you want to customize agent names, run fewer agents, or understand what's happening under the hood.

## Getting Started

<!-- Add your project-specific setup instructions here -->

## Multi-Agent Development

This repo is configured for parallel AI agent development. Each AI CLI reads its own instruction file:

| CLI | Instruction File |
|-----|------------------|
| Claude Code | [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) |
| OpenAI Codex | [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) |
| Gemini CLI | [GEMINI.md](GEMINI.md) |

**Quick start for agents:**
```bash
./tools/worktree/worktreectl.sh create <agent-name>
code ../.worktrees/<repo>/worktree_<agent-name>
```

# Manual Setup Guide

The detailed walkthrough below explains the manual process. Use this if you want to customize your setup, understand how worktrees work, or troubleshoot issues.

> **⚠️ Template Placeholders:** If following the manual process, remember to replace example paths like `widget-frontend` with your actual project name throughout.

## Phase 1: Create a Repo from This Template

1. Go to your template repo on GitHub (e.g., `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/civics-template`)
2. Click **"Use this template"** → **"Create a new repository"**
3. Name your new repo (e.g., `widget-frontend`)
4. Select **Private** or **Public**
5. Click **"Create repository"**

## Phase 2: Clone and Add Your Project Code

1. **Clone with GitHub Desktop:**
   - Open GitHub Desktop
   - File → Clone Repository
   - Select your new repo
   - Clone to your preferred location (e.g., `~/Documents/GitHub/widget-frontend`)

2. **Add your project code to `main`:**
   - Copy your existing project files into the repo
   - Create a `dev_plan.md` with implementation details for the agents
   - Commit and push to `main`

## Phase 3: Create Worktrees (One per Agent)

Open Terminal in your repo directory and run:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/widget-frontend

# Create worktree for Claude Code
./tools/worktree/worktreectl.sh create claude-task

# Create worktree for Codex
./tools/worktree/worktreectl.sh create codex-task

# Create worktree for Gemini
./tools/worktree/worktreectl.sh create gemini-task
```

This creates:
```
../.worktrees/widget-frontend/
    worktree_claude-task/   (branch: agent/claude-task)
    worktree_codex-task/    (branch: agent/codex-task)
    worktree_gemini-task/   (branch: agent/gemini-task)
```

## Phase 4: Open Separate VS Code Windows

Run these commands to open each worktree in its own VS Code window:

```bash
# Window 1 - Claude Code
code ~/Documents/GitHub/.worktrees/widget-frontend/worktree_claude-task

# Window 2 - Codex
code ~/Documents/GitHub/.worktrees/widget-frontend/worktree_codex-task

# Window 3 - Gemini
code ~/Documents/GitHub/.worktrees/widget-frontend/worktree_gemini-task
```

You now have **3 separate VS Code windows**, each on its own branch.

## Phase 5: Start Each AI CLI

In each VS Code window, open the integrated terminal and start the CLI:

| Window | CLI | Command |
|--------|-----|---------|
| 1 | Claude Code | `claude` |
| 2 | Codex | `codex` |
| 3 | Gemini | `gemini` |

Each CLI automatically reads its instruction file (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `GEMINI.md`).

## Phase 6: Assign Tasks

You have two workflow options:

### Option A: Divide and Conquer (Different Tasks)

Each agent works on a different part of the project:

**Claude Code (Window 1):**
```
Read dev_plan.md and implement the header component as described in section 1.
```

**Codex (Window 2):**
```
Read dev_plan.md and implement the sidebar component as described in section 2.
```

**Gemini (Window 3):**
```
Read dev_plan.md and implement the footer component as described in section 3.
```

### Option B: Competitive Build (Same Task, Best-of-Breed)

All agents implement the **entire project** independently. You then compare implementations and synthesize the best parts of each.

**Give the same prompt to all three agents:**
```
Read dev_plan.md and implement the complete project as specified.
Commit your work when done and push to your branch.
```

This produces 3 complete implementations you can compare. Proceed to Phase 7B for the cross-review workflow.

## Phase 7: Review and Merge

### Option 7A: Standard Review (for Divide and Conquer)

When agents complete their work:

1. Each agent commits and pushes to their branch (`agent/claude-task`, etc.)
2. Go to GitHub and create PRs from each agent branch to `main`
3. Review each PR
4. Merge the ones you approve

### Option 7B: Cross-Agent Review (for Competitive Build)

Have each agent review the others' implementations to identify the best ideas:

**Step 1: Create PRs for all three implementations**
```bash
# In the main repo, create PRs (or do this on GitHub)
gh pr create --head agent/claude-task --title "Claude implementation"
gh pr create --head agent/codex-task --title "Codex implementation"
gh pr create --head agent/gemini-task --title "Gemini implementation"
```

**Step 2: Have each agent review the other PRs**

In **Claude Code's window**, ask:
```
Review the PRs from the other agents:
- Run: git fetch origin
- Run: git diff main..origin/agent/codex-task
- Run: git diff main..origin/agent/gemini-task

Compare their implementations to yours. Identify:
1. What they did better than you
2. What you did better than them
3. Bugs or issues in their code
4. Ideas worth adopting

Write your review as a comment. Be specific with file paths and line numbers.
```

In **Codex's window**, ask:
```
Review the PRs from the other agents:
- Run: git fetch origin
- Run: git diff main..origin/agent/claude-task
- Run: git diff main..origin/agent/gemini-task

Compare their implementations to yours. Identify:
1. What they did better than you
2. What you did better than them
3. Bugs or issues in their code
4. Ideas worth adopting

Write your review as a comment. Be specific with file paths and line numbers.
```

In **Gemini's window**, ask:
```
Review the PRs from the other agents:
- Run: git fetch origin
- Run: git diff main..origin/agent/claude-task
- Run: git diff main..origin/agent/codex-task

Compare their implementations to yours. Identify:
1. What they did better than you
2. What you did better than them
3. Bugs or issues in their code
4. Ideas worth adopting

Write your review as a comment. Be specific with file paths and line numbers.
```

**Step 3: Synthesize the best implementation**

After reading all reviews, choose one of these approaches:

**A) Pick a winner and enhance:**
Pick the best overall implementation as your base, then ask that agent:
```
Based on the reviews, incorporate the best ideas from the other implementations:
- [List specific improvements from other agents]
Update your code and push.
```

**B) Create a synthesis branch:**
Create a new worktree for the final version:
```bash
./tools/worktree/worktreectl.sh create final-synthesis
```

Then ask one agent to synthesize:
```
Create the best-of-breed implementation by combining:
- From Claude's PR: [specific features/approaches]
- From Codex's PR: [specific features/approaches]
- From Gemini's PR: [specific features/approaches]

Cherry-pick or reimplement the best parts from each.
```

**Step 4: Final review and merge**
Once you have your synthesized best version, merge it to `main`.

## Phase 8: Cleanup

When done with all agents:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/widget-frontend

./tools/worktree/worktreectl.sh remove claude-task --delete-branch
./tools/worktree/worktreectl.sh remove codex-task --delete-branch
./tools/worktree/worktreectl.sh remove gemini-task --delete-branch
```
